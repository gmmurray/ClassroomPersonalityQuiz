    'Lions are leaders. They are usually the bosses at work…or at least they think they are! They are decisive, bottom line folks who are observers, not watchers or listeners. They love to solve problems. They are usually individualists who love to seek new adventures and opportunities.',
    'Lions are very confident and self-reliant. In a group setting, if no one else instantly takes charge, the Lion will. Unfortunately, if they don\'t learn how to tone down their aggressiveness, their natural dominating traits can cause problems with others. Most entrepeneurs are strong lions, or at least have a lot of lion in them.'

    'Otters are excitable, fun seeking, cheerleader types who love to talk! They\'re great at motivating others and need to be in an environment where they can talk and have a vote on major decisions. The otters’ outgoing nature makes them great networkers—they usually know a lot of people who know a lot of people. They can be very loving and encouraging unless under pressure, when they tend to use their verbal skills to attack. They have a strong desire to be liked and enjoy being the center of attention. They are often very attentive to style, clothes, and flash. Otters are the life of any party and most people really enjoy being around them.'

    'One word describes these people: LOYAL. They\'re so loyal, in fact, that they can absorb the most emotional pain and punishment in a relationship and still stay committed. They are great listeners, incredibly empathetic and warm encouragers. However, they tend to be such pleasers that they can have great difficulty being assertive in a situation or relationship when it’s needed.'

    'Beavers have a strong need to do things right and by the book. In fact, they are the kind of people who actually read instruction manuals. They are great at providing quality control in an office, and will provide quality control in any situation or field that demands accuracy, such as accounting, engineering, etc. Because rules, consistency and high standards are so important to beavers, they are often frustrated with others who do not share these same characteristics. Their strong need for maintaining high (and oftentimes unrealistic) standards can short-circuit their ability to express warmth in a relationship.'
